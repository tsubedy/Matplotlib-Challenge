Analysis: 

A total of 249 mice were in the given data after merging two separate dataset. Duplicated data rows were identified and removed from the final data set that is used in the analysis. A total of 248 mice of which 123 were female and 125 were male were included in the analysis. 

Various treatment were applied during the experiemtnal study of the mouse. Among the Drug Regimens, Capomulin was used for 230 mice where as 182 mice were put under Zoniferol. 

A total tumor volume for each type was compiled at the highest level of timepoint and analysed if there is any relationship with mouse weights.   

Pearson's correlation between the average tumor volume and the weight of mouse was found to be 0.84, which is a strong positive correlation. 
The regression analysis was performed and found that 70% of the model fits the data which resembles that the model is fairly strong to predict the effect of Drug Regimens on the gain of weights.
